# Overlook Hotel

## Abstract

This was a Turing School, Mod 2, final project. The focus for this project was implementing GET and POST calls to an API, as well as continuing to build upon our Array Prototype Methods and utilizing SCSS. This project was built by myself [Kai Kuller](https://github.com/kavakai) in just under a week, or a total of approximately 40hrs. You can find the original project specs [HERE](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html).

## Future Additions

-A Manager class, which would have a separate display upon login, and separate app interactions such as...
    -Deleting a booking
    -Viewing todays bookings
    -Getting an estimated total revinue for each day

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
